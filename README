Despite its name, omchreode can be loaded into OM as well as PWGL.

Installation in PWGL
--------------------
omchreode depends on ompw, which is already included with
PWGL. Because of that, I recommend getting the latest version of PWGL
at http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL/downloads.html.

Then download omchreode from
http://github.com/kisp/omchreode/tarball/master which always points to
the latest version. Uncompress and rename the directory to omchreode
if you like.

A good location to place it is in $HOME/PWGL-User/User-library.

Installation in OM
--------------------
omchreode depends on ompw, which also needs to be installed. Download
it from http://github.com/kisp/ompw/tarball/master which always points
to the latest version. Uncompress and *rename* the directory to ompw.

Then download omchreode from
http://github.com/kisp/omchreode/tarball/master which always points to
the latest version. Uncompress and *rename* the directory to
omchreode.

A good location to place the two libraries is in
/Applications/OM-6.2.2-SRC/libraries (depending on your OM version).
